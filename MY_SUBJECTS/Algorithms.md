# Definition:
    it is a step by step instruction to solve a computational problem.

# Characteristics of an algorithm:
    1.Input   

    2.Output

    3.Definiteness

    4.finiteness

    5.Effectively


# Brief description about characteristics:   

   #### 1.Input:
    An algorithm must have certain inputs.

   #### 2.Output:
    Algorithm must contain one output.

   #### 3.Definiteness:
    Algoritm must be unambigious. 

   #### 4.Finiteness
    Algorithm must have only finite no of steps.
   
   #### 5.Effectively
    Algorithm does not contain any unnecessary steps 

 # Performance Analysis Of an algorithm:
    It's nothing but how the performance of algorithm in during the implementation part.
 
 We can analyse the algorithm in different views:
 * Time Complexity
 * Space Complexity

 

 ### Time Complexity:
  The rate of change of time while in execution of an algorithm with respect to change in inputs.

 There are different types of time complexities:

 * O(n)
 * O(logn)
 * O(n^2)
 * O(nlogn)
 * O(n^3)
 * O(1) etc.,

 #### O(1):
 it is also known as "Linear Time complexity".

    The execution time of an algorithm won't change irrespective any no of inputs.

 #### O(n^2):
 it is also known as "Quadratic Time Complexity".

 ```
   The execution time of an algorithm increases quadratically with respect to inputs.
```
#### O(logn):
it is also known as "Logarithmic Time Complexity".

```
   The execution time of an algorithm decreases logarithmically with respect to change in the size of inputs.
