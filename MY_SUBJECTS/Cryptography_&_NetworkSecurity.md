## Basic Definitions:    

 ### Cryptography:
    It is the process encrypting and decrypting the message.
 ### Network Security:
    It is the process of providing encryption methods for securing the network.
 ### Encryption:
     it is the process of encoding or encrypting the message by using an algorithm.
 Ex:"Hi" ->"xw".
 ### Decryption:
     It is the process of decoding or decrypting the message by using an algorithm.
 Ex:"xw" -> "hi".


There are some mechanisms for Encryption and some mechanisms for Decryption.
